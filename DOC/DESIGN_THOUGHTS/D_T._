    Should Server Have State ? Or should it all be stored
    on database? I think server state might be kind of
    difficult, so lets stick to database holding information
    for now.

//:MOOD_LIGHTING_API:========================================://

    We should make an API that allows a user to set the
    "clear color" in the database to a color of their
    choice. Maybe call it "Global Mood Lighting" or something.

    The point is just to get something that a user of game
    can do that effects everyone else in the game.

    API_PUT_GML( "0x00220044" , "2022_06_20:8PM" );

    Eventually have a "no spam" mode where if there is
    already an entry in the mood lighting table, another
    user cannot set it. So it is a first-come, first 
    serve thing. Also make it so one user cannot
    do this too many times.
